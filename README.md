# Selection Sort – DAA

This project implements the **Selection Sort** algorithm in Java.  
The algorithm repeatedly finds the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and places it in the correct position.

### Features
- Simple and clear implementation of Selection Sort
- Performance tracking using `PerformanceTracker`
- Benchmark tests for different input sizes using `BenchmarkRunner`
- Unit tests with JUnit 5 to check sorting correctness

### Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n²)
- **Average Case:** O(n²)
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) – in-place sorting

### Performance
Performance tests show that the execution time increases approximately with the square of the input size, matching the theoretical complexity.
